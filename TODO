Features
========
- save/load stock data from file
- get stock data (prices, etc) from yahoo or other websites
- recalculate stock rating periodically
- save old stock ratings



# TODO: 
- add CLI:
 - allow to enter new STocks with symbol
 - offer to load stock data if it already exist
   - check which values are outdated and have to be entered again

- check also main.py with pylint

- EBIT Margin for 2016 still not available for a lot of stocks at January 2017,
  how to handle it? The program asks for ebit margin of 2016
  Check if current date < 2. quarter of the year? If yes, ask if the data from
  the previous year should be used?
- allow to enter NO analyst rating on the CLI, some stocks dont have a analyst
  rating on yahoo
- add README.mde file for github
- clean up code, push to github
- add todos to github
- don't mix up currencies, e.g. get stock quote in USD and have EPS from
  onvista in EUR 
- get some fundamental data from https://blog.quandl.com/api-for-stock-data (eg
  ebit margin)
- add support for non-Dax Stocks
- write more tests, ensure functions are also working correctly in corner cases
  (getting quotes on weekend  days, year breaks, etc)
- only ask for stock data that is outdated on the CLI
- require to enter currency symbol for market cap, output the currency symbol
  from stock.__str__()
- Store portfolio
- store previous levermann rating to compare it with the current one, if the
  stock was bought and lost >=2 Points advise to sell it
- store Levermann CriteriaRating in EvaluationResult to archive all previous
  evaluation results
- store objects as JSON instead of using pickle? Would make it easier to
  transist objects to new versions?
- store yahoo and onvista fundamental analysis website link in stock, show it
  when entering data to make it easier to find the data?
- Rename input module, to not clash with the naming of the input() function
- make levermann evaluation threaded to speed it up (YQL queries take lot of
  time)

- todo: verify, do we also need the timezone for the quarterly figures
release date??
# could it happen that when the date for the quarterly figures is in a
# differnt timezone than the stock exchange, that we compare the wrong
# dates?
# is it ensured that the quarterly figures are released during the time the
# exchange is open? or could it be released outside of their opening hours
# and we would have to check the following day instead?
